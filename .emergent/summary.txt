The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the How to Bangalore application from static content to a dynamic, user-managed platform. Key initial efforts involved fixing critical HTML formatting issues, then building a comprehensive admin system with JWT authentication, file upload (Markdown/HTML), and an in-browser rich text editor (migrating from ReactQuill to TinyMCE). The engineer ensured subcategories were optional, links opened in new tabs, and restricted admin registration. Subsequent work focused on UI/UX, including resolving title duplication in blog posts (removing redundancy and converting content H1s to H2s), restyling the Table of Contents for seamless integration, and adding functional share buttons (replacing save buttons). A hero section redesign with animations, mobile responsiveness across the application, and initial attempts at populating featured articles were also completed. The immediate preceding work involved removing auto-generated articles and setting existing ones as featured, alongside simplifying the header design.

The How to Bangalore application aims to be a comprehensive blog for Bangalore insights, featuring 2000-3000 word, SEO-ready articles with proper HTML structure and local images. UI/UX requirements include proper header alignment, no dark overlays on posts, and a sticky Table of Contents.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : FastAPI backend, managing admin authentication (JWT), article CRUD, file uploads, and HTML entity decoding for titles. Recently, it was used for deleting and updating article features.
-   : React entry point and router. Integrates , and defines admin routes.
-   : Displays articles and handles the hero section. Recently modified to remove 2000+ Words Each text and redesigned with animations for a vibrant hero section, and for mobile responsiveness (category grids).

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue setting existing articles as featured (after removing the ones added by script).
-   Update empty pages: create a simple Contact Us form (sends emails to  via backend, no contact details on frontend).
-   Build all legal pages.

<current_work>
The immediate current work involves addressing the user's feedback on the content and design. The AI engineer has just completed the following:

1.  **Revising Featured Articles**: The user explicitly requested to use *already uploaded* articles for the featured section and to *remove any newly added articles*.
    *   The AI engineer identified and deleted 10 articles that were previously added via a script ().
    *   It then started the process of setting existing articles as featured by updating them via the backend API's  endpoint. At the end of the trajectory, only one article was explicitly shown as being set to featured.

2.  **Redesigning the Header**: The user expressed dissatisfaction with the previous header and asked for a simpler design, with categories shown in another way.
    *   The AI engineer is currently refactoring the  component. It has removed the previous complex header structure (including dropdowns) and is implementing a cleaner, simpler design. The immediate next step would be to fully implement the new approach for categories.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Complete the redesign of the header to simplify category display and mark remaining existing articles as featured.
