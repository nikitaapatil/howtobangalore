The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the How to Bangalore blog application, progressing from a basic frontend with mock data to a full-stack solution featuring AI-generated articles. Development involved significant UI/UX refinements, including header alignment, removal of image overlays, and implementation of a sticky Table of Contents. Challenges included API rate limits and precise UI adjustments. The current phase is crucial: transitioning from AI-generated content to user-provided markdown articles. The engineer has successfully downloaded and processed the first 5 user-provided markdown files using a new Python script (), converting them into JSON () and JS mock data (). The immediate task remaining is to integrate these newly processed articles into the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The user requested How to Bangalore, a full-stack blog application delivering comprehensive, deeply researched articles about Bangalore. Initial setup involved a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. The frontend needed to be functional with mock data first, ensuring interactive elements worked. Articles were required to be 2000-3000 words, provide insider knowledge, be SEO-ready with H1-H3 markups and short paragraphs, and include locally stored featured images. UI/UX improvements included proper header alignment, no dark overlay on post pages, and a floating/sticky Table of Contents (TOC) moved to the right. The application transitioned from AI-generated content to user-provided high-quality markdown files, with an initial 5 files supplied out of an expected 50, alongside a requirement for local image storage.

    -   **Summary**: The primary React entry point, responsible for routing , , , , and . Integrates  and .
    -   **Changes Made**: Evolved to support comprehensive navigation and content display from updated mock data.

-    (and successors):
    -   **Summary**: Served as the initial content source. Iteratively updated to hold AI-generated, then image-rich, and finally HTML-formatted article data (). Now,  and  are intended to replace these.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant evolution in content structure and richness; currently superseded by newly generated user article data.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Manages site navigation, search, and header elements.
    -   **Changes Made**: Refined for proper alignment, category navigation, and search functionality.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Displays individual blog posts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to render comprehensive HTML content, featured images, removed a dark overlay, and integrated the  component.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Provides a floating/sticky table of contents for article navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented initially on the left, then moved to the right sidebar and made sticky, dynamically generating links from headings.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: The FastAPI backend, defines API endpoints and connects to MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: Started with basic Hello World and a  endpoint. Most recent work has been frontend-focused, but this remains the core backend.

-    (and similar scripts):
    -   **Summary**: Python scripts used to generate mock article content via Gemini API.
    -   **Changes Made**: Iterated to produce SEO-optimized, markdown-formatted content for populating mock data files.

-    (NEW):
    -   **Summary**: A newly created Python script designed to process user-provided markdown article files. It reads markdown, extracts content, converts it to a structured format (likely HTML for display), and generates JSON and JS files for frontend consumption.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to automate the ingestion of user-provided markdown, transforming it into  and .

-    (NEW) and  (NEW):
    -   **Summary**: New data files generated by . These files contain the structured content derived from the 5 user-provided markdown articles.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were created dynamically to hold the processed content, effectively becoming the new content source for the frontend.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate the remaining user-provided markdown articles (45 more files are expected).
-   Ensure all images within the provided markdown articles are stored locally on the server (this was part of the processing but might require further handling for embedded images).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on integrating user-provided, human-curated content into the How to Bangalore application, replacing the previously AI-generated articles. The AI engineer has just successfully completed the first major step of this transition.

Specifically:
1.  The 5 initial markdown articles provided by the user ( through ) have been successfully retrieved and downloaded into the  directory.
2.  A new Python script, , was created and utilized for content processing. This script, requiring the  Python library (which was installed), reads the raw markdown files.
3.  The script then processes these markdown articles, converting their content into a structured format suitable for the frontend.
4.  As a result of this processing, two new files were generated in the frontend's data directory:
    *   : Contains the structured data for the 5 processed articles.
    *   : Likely exports the same structured data as a JavaScript module.
These new files ( and ) now hold the 5 user-provided articles, replacing the old mock data () as the intended content source. The previous AI engineer stated the Next step: Update the frontend to use the new data files.
