The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the How to Bangalore application from an AI-generated content model to one powered by user-provided markdown articles. Initial work involved processing 5 user markdown files into  and . The engineer then proceeded to integrate this new data into the React frontend, updating , , , and  to consume the flat data structure. Visual confirmation via screenshots showed the homepage and individual blog posts loading correctly, displaying featured images and the Table of Contents. However, the user identified a critical issue: the HTML formatting within the articles was not preserved. The engineer diagnosed this, finding that the processed HTML content was incorrectly wrapped in markdown code block syntax ( and ) within the JSON data, and was in the process of rectifying this.

<product_requirements>
The How to Bangalore application is a full-stack blog delivering comprehensive, deeply researched articles about Bangalore. It features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Articles must be 2000-3000 words, provide insider knowledge, be SEO-ready with H1-H3 markups and short paragraphs, and include locally stored featured images. UI/UX requirements include proper header alignment, no dark overlay on post pages, and a sticky Table of Contents (TOC) positioned on the right. The application has transitioned from AI-generated content to user-provided, human-curated markdown files, with the first 5 of an expected 50 files already processed and integrated into the frontend.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work involved the successful processing and frontend integration of the first 5 user-provided markdown articles. The  script was used to convert these markdown files ( through ) into structured JSON () and JavaScript mock data ().

Following this, the frontend components were updated to consume this new data:
-    was adjusted to handle the new data flow.
-    was modified multiple times to correctly render the flat data structure, display base64 encoded featured images, and integrate the Table of Contents component.
-    and  were updated to correctly filter and display articles based on the new flat article structure.

After these integrations, initial screenshots confirmed the homepage and individual blog posts were loading and displaying content, featured images, and a functional Table of Contents. However, the user provided feedback that the HTML is not preserved - the formatting is completely off. Upon investigation, the previous engineer discovered that the HTML content within  was incorrectly wrapped with markdown code block delimiters ( at the start and  at the end). The trajectory ends with the engineer identifying this issue and stating the intention to fix it.
