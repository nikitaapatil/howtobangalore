# Address Proof 101: How to Update Your Aadhaar Address Instantly

Moving to a new home means updating your address on important documents, and your Aadhaar card is no exception. Many people don't realize that [rental agreements are accepted by UIDAI](https://www.shreeyanshlegal.com/aadhar-card-address-change/) as valid address proof for updating their Aadhaar information, making the process much easier for tenants.

![A person sitting at a desk updating their Aadhaar card using a rental agreement, with a service center visible in the background.](https://koala.sh/api/image/v2-yhcq0-zshiw.jpg?width=1216\&height=832\&dream)

**You can update your Aadhaar address using a rental agreement through both online and offline methods, with the entire process being straightforward once you have the right documents.** The key is understanding which documents are needed, where to find the nearest service centers, and choosing the best method for your situation.

This guide walks through everything from eligibility requirements to tracking your update request. Whether someone prefers the convenience of [online updates through the myAadhaar portal](https://www.taxbuddy.com/blog/aadhaar-card-address-change-online) or visiting an Aadhaar Seva Kendra in person, both options offer reliable ways to keep their address information current and avoid issues with government services or financial transactions.

## Understanding Aadhaar Address Updates

![Hands holding a rental agreement with a laptop, smartphone, and printed forms on a desk showing steps to update Aadhaar address.](https://koala.sh/api/image/v2-yhcqj-l3rev.jpg?width=1216\&height=832\&dream)

Updating your Aadhaar address is crucial for accessing government services and financial products. The process involves specific eligibility requirements and affects how your unique identification works across different platforms.

### Importance of Keeping Address Updated

Your Aadhaar card serves as both identity and address proof for many essential services. Banks require current address details when opening accounts or processing loans.

Government benefit programs use Aadhaar address information to verify eligibility. An outdated address can delay or prevent access to these services.

Mobile phone companies and internet providers also check Aadhaar addresses during new connections. [Updating your Aadhaar card address is essential to ensure seamless access to government services and financial transactions](https://www.commercetutors.com/2025/02/how-to-change-address-in-aadhaar-card.html).

Insurance companies use this information for policy verification. Property transactions often require proof of current residence through Aadhaar.

**Key services that require updated Aadhaar address:**

* Bank account opening
* Loan applications
* Government scheme enrollment
* Mobile/internet connections
* Insurance policies
* Property registrations

### Who Can Update Address in Aadhaar

Only the Aadhaar holder can update their own address information. No family member or representative can make changes on someone else's behalf.

The person must be at least 18 years old to update their address independently. Minors need a parent or guardian to make address changes.

**Eligibility requirements:**

* Must be the actual Aadhaar holder
* Need valid proof of address document
* Must have access to registered mobile number
* Should possess current Aadhaar number

[UIDAI allows address corrections both online and through Aadhaar Seva Kendras](https://udaipurkiran.com/aadhaar-card-address-update-step-by-step-guide-to-changing-your-address-online-or-at-a-service-center). The process requires authentication through OTP sent to the registered phone number.

### Aadhaar Number and Personal Information

Your 12-digit Aadhaar number stays the same even after address updates. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) maintains this number throughout your lifetime.

Address changes only affect the demographic information linked to your Aadhaar number. Your biometric data and unique identification remain unchanged.

The system links your new address to the existing Aadhaar number in the database. This ensures all previous authentications and linkages remain valid.

**Information that changes:**

* Residential address
* Pin code
* State and district details

**Information that stays same:**

* 12-digit Aadhaar number
* Fingerprints and iris scans
* Facial photograph
* Name and date of birth

UIDAI processes address updates within 7-10 working days. The updated information becomes available for authentication immediately after approval.

## Requirements and Eligibility for Address Update

![People at a government service center submitting documents for Aadhaar address update with staff assisting them.](https://koala.sh/api/image/v2-yhcr8-kwuuv.jpg?width=1216\&height=832\&dream)

The UIDAI has specific requirements that must be met before anyone can update their Aadhaar address. A registered mobile number is mandatory for online services, and certain eligibility criteria apply to all applicants.

### Registered Mobile Number Prerequisite

A registered mobile number is essential for updating Aadhaar address details online. [Mobile number registration is required for using any online Aadhaar services](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html).

The UIDAI uses this mobile number to send important updates. Users receive SMS notifications with their Service Request Number (SRN) after submitting address change requests.

Without a registered mobile number, people cannot access the online portal. They must visit an Aadhaar enrollment center to register their mobile number first.

**Important:** The mobile number must be active and accessible. OTP verification is used during the address update process to confirm the user's identity.

People who don't have a registered mobile number can [locate nearby enrollment centers through the Bhuvan Aadhaar Portal](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) to register their number.

### Who Is Eligible for an Update

All Aadhaar holders can update their address information. There are no age restrictions or special conditions that prevent someone from changing their address details.

**Key eligibility points:**

* Must have a valid Aadhaar number
* Need access to registered mobile number
* Must provide valid proof of address documents
* Can update address multiple times if needed

Children and adults follow the same process. Parents or guardians can update address details for minors using their own registered mobile numbers.

People who have lost their Aadhaar card can still update their address. The 12-digit Aadhaar number is sufficient to begin the update process online or at service centers.

## Rental Agreement as Address Proof for Aadhaar

![A person holding a rental agreement document with an Aadhaar card and a laptop on a desk in an office setting.](https://koala.sh/api/image/v2-yhcs2-fhxam.jpg?width=1216\&height=832\&dream)

Rental agreements are valid documents for updating your Aadhaar address, but specific requirements must be met. The type of agreement and proper documentation play crucial roles in successful address updates.

### Acceptability of Rental Agreements

The UIDAI accepts [rental agreements as one of 44 valid documents](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/updating-aadhaar-card-address-with-rent-agreement-3-things-to-keep-in-mind-11571292123349.html) for Aadhaar address updates. This makes them a popular choice for tenants who need to change their registered address.

**Key Requirements:**

* Agreement must be legally valid
* Property owner's details must be complete
* Tenant's name should match Aadhaar records
* Document should be clear and readable

The rental agreement serves as proof that the person lives at the specified address. It shows the relationship between the tenant and the property owner.

UIDAI staff verify these documents carefully during the update process. They check that all details match the information provided in the application.

### Registered vs Notarized Agreements

**Registered agreements** are filed with local government offices and carry more legal weight. These documents go through official verification processes before approval.

**Notarized agreements** are verified by notary public officers but are not registered with government offices. They still serve as valid proof for Aadhaar updates.

| Agreement Type | Legal Status | Acceptance Rate |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Registered     | Higher       | Better          |
| Notarized      | Standard     | Good            |
| Simple         | Basic        | May face issues |

Both types work for Aadhaar updates, but registered agreements face fewer questions during verification. Simple rental agreements without notarization may require additional supporting documents.

### Common Mistakes with Rental Agreements

**Incomplete owner information** is the most frequent error. The property owner's full name, address, and contact details must be clearly mentioned in the agreement.

**Mismatched names** between the Aadhaar card and rental agreement cause rejections. The tenant's name should exactly match their Aadhaar records.

**Poor document quality** leads to processing delays. [Scanned copies must be clear and readable](https://uidai.gov.in/en/1045-english-uk/faqs/enrolment-update/myaadhaar-online-update-service/13901-how-can-i-submit-my-supporting-documents-in-case-of-address-update-online-service.html) when submitted online.

**Missing signatures** from either party make the document invalid. Both tenant and owner must sign the agreement properly.

**Expired agreements** are not accepted for address updates. The rental agreement should be current and valid at the time of application.

## Other Valid Documents for Aadhaar Address Update

![Person updating Aadhaar address information at a desk with documents and a laptop, with a government service center visible in the background.](https://koala.sh/api/image/v2-yhcst-mmvhm.jpg?width=1216\&height=832\&dream)

The UIDAI accepts [45 different documents as address proof](https://www.india.com/business/aadhaar-card-update-13-january-2022-list-of-45-documents-that-can-be-used-as-proof-of-address-uidai-brings-changes-in-guidelines-for-address-change-check-step-by-step-guide-here-5183671/) for updating address details. These documents include utility bills, government-issued IDs, and bank records that must be valid and show the person's current address.

### Electricity Bill and Water Bill Usage

Utility bills serve as the most common proof of address for Aadhaar updates. An electricity bill must be issued within the last three months to be valid. The bill should clearly show the person's name and complete address.

Water bills follow the same requirements as electricity bills. They need to be recent and display the applicant's name exactly as it appears on other documents.

Both types of utility bills are widely accepted because they prove someone actually lives at the address. The bills must be original copies or certified photocopies. Digital bills are also accepted if they can be verified online.

Many people prefer using utility bills because they are easy to obtain. Most households receive these bills regularly, making them convenient proof documents.

### Bank Passbook, Voter ID, and Driving License

A bank passbook works as valid address proof if it shows the person's current address. The passbook must be from a recognized bank and contain recent entries. Banks usually print the address on the first page of the passbook.

The voter ID card is another reliable document for address updates. It must be issued by the Election Commission of India. The address on the voter ID should match the new address being updated in Aadhaar.

A driving license serves as both identity and address proof. The license must be valid and not expired. The address printed on the driving license should be the same as the one being updated.

These documents carry more weight because they are government-issued or from regulated institutions. They undergo verification processes before being issued, making them trustworthy proof sources.

### Passport and Other Acceptable Proofs

The [passport stands as one of the strongest address proofs](https://www.digit.in/how-to/general/how-to-update-aadhaar-card-address-address-proof-mandatory-60704.html) accepted by UIDAI. It must be valid and show the person's current address. The passport works well for people who have recently moved and updated their passport address.

Other acceptable documents include ration cards, property tax receipts, and insurance policies. Gas connection bills and telephone bills also qualify as valid proof. Property registration documents work for homeowners.

Post office account statements and pension payment orders are accepted too. Government employee ID cards with addresses can serve as proof. Even school or college ID cards work in some cases.

The key requirement for all documents is that they must be **currently valid** and show the person's name and address clearly. [Documents must meet specific conditions](https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf) set by UIDAI to be acceptable for address updates.

## How to Update Aadhaar Address Online

The online method allows users to [update their Aadhaar address through the UIDAI portal](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) by accessing the self-service platform, uploading required documents, and tracking the request through a unique service number.

### Accessing the Aadhaar Self Service Update Portal

Users can visit the official UIDAI self-service portal at ssup.uidai.gov.in to begin the address update process. The portal requires an active internet connection and a registered mobile number linked to the Aadhaar card.

The user needs to enter their 12-digit Aadhaar number on the homepage. After entering the number, they must click the "Send OTP" button to receive a verification code.

**Required Information:**

* 12-digit Aadhaar number
* Registered mobile number
* Valid email address (optional)

The system sends a one-time password to the registered mobile number within a few minutes. Users should enter this OTP to verify their identity and proceed to the next step.

The portal is available 24/7, making it convenient for users to update their information at any time. However, maintenance windows may occasionally limit access during late night hours.

### Steps to Complete the Online Update

Once logged in, users need to select the "Address Update" option from the available services. The system will generate another OTP along with a consent link sent to the registered mobile number.

The user must click the consent link and enter the new OTP to acknowledge permission for the address change. This step ensures security and prevents unauthorized modifications to personal information.

**Update Process:**

1. Select "Address Update" checkbox
2. Receive consent link via SMS
3. Click link and enter OTP
4. Fill address details in English
5. Add local language translation
6. Upload supporting documents

Users must fill in the complete new address in both English and their local language. The form requires details like house number, street name, city, state, and PIN code.

All fields marked with asterisks are mandatory and must be completed accurately. Incomplete forms will be rejected by the system.

### Uploading Documents and File Format Guidelines

The system accepts specific document formats for address proof verification. [Users must upload a colored scanned copy of their rental agreement](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/documents/how-to-update-the-aadhaar-card-address-with-rent-agreement/articleshow/72467863.cms) or other valid address proof documents.

**File Requirements:**

* **Format:** PDF only (no JPEG or JPG images)
* **Size:** Maximum 2MB per document
* **Quality:** Clear, readable scan
* **Color:** Colored documents preferred

All pages of multi-page documents must be combined into a single PDF file. The UIDAI system automatically rejects multiple separate image files or incomplete document uploads.

The rental agreement must be registered and in the applicant's name. Agreements in family members' names are not accepted for address updates.

Users should ensure the scanned document shows all text clearly without shadows or blurred sections. Poor quality uploads often lead to application rejection.

### Tracking Request with Service Request Number

After successful submission, the system generates a unique Service Request Number (SRN) for tracking purposes. Users should note down this SRN immediately as it serves as the primary reference for the application.

The SRN allows users to check their application status through the UIDAI website. The tracking system shows real-time updates about document verification and processing stages.

**Tracking Information:**

* **SRN Format:** 14-digit alphanumeric code
* **Processing Time:** 7-15 working days
* **Status Updates:** Available online 24/7
* **SMS Alerts:** Sent to registered mobile

Users can visit the UIDAI portal and enter their SRN in the "Check Status" section. The system displays current status, estimated completion time, and any additional requirements.

An acknowledgment receipt is generated after submission. Users should download and print this receipt for their records and future reference.

## How to Update Aadhaar Address Offline

The offline process requires visiting an [Aadhaar Seva Kendra](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) with original documents and completing paperwork in person. This method offers direct assistance from staff members and immediate document verification.

### Locating and Visiting an Aadhaar Seva Kendra

People can find their nearest [Aadhaar Seva Kendra location](https://udaipurkiran.com/aadhaar-card-address-update-step-by-step-guide-to-changing-your-address-online-or-at-a-service-center/) using the UIDAI website's center locator tool. They should enter their pin code or district name to see available options.

Most centers operate during standard business hours from Monday to Saturday. It's smart to call ahead and confirm timings before visiting.

**Required items to bring:**

* Original Aadhaar card
* Original proof of address documents
* Mobile phone for OTP verification
* Small amount of cash for fees

People should arrive early to avoid long waiting times. Peak hours are usually late morning and early evening when most people visit after work.

Some centers offer appointment booking to reduce wait times. This service helps people plan their visit better and saves time.

### Filling the Aadhaar Update Form

Staff members at the center will provide an Aadhaar Update Form (AUF) that needs to be filled out completely. The form asks for basic personal details and the specific changes being requested.

People must write their new address clearly in both English and their local language. Any spelling mistakes or unclear writing can cause delays in processing.

**Key sections to complete:**

* Personal information (name, Aadhaar number)
* Current address details
* New address information
* Reason for address change
* Contact details

The form requires signatures in multiple places. Staff can help explain which sections need attention if people have questions.

Double-checking all information before submission prevents common errors. Once submitted, changes to the form become difficult to make.

### Document Verification Process

Center staff will examine all original documents against the copies provided. They check that names match exactly and addresses are current and valid.

For rental agreements, the document must be registered and in the applicant's name. [Original rent agreements are necessary](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/documents/how-to-update-the-aadhaar-card-address-with-rent-agreement/articleshow/72467863.cms) when visiting permanent enrollment centers.

**Verification steps include:**

* Document authenticity check
* Biometric verification (fingerprint and iris scan)
* Photograph capture
* Mobile number verification via OTP

Staff will provide a receipt with an Update Request Number (URN) after successful verification. This number helps track the application status online.

The [address update process may take up to 90 days](https://www.indiatoday.in/information/story/how-to-update-address-on-aadhaar-card-2477282-2023-12-18) to complete. People receive SMS updates about their application progress on their registered mobile number.

## Comparing Online vs Offline Aadhaar Address Update

The [online process takes less time than the offline process](https://www.servicesutra.com/blog/guide-to-updating-aadhaar-address-online-offline/) but requires specific technical knowledge and a linked mobile number. Processing speeds vary significantly between methods, with different document requirements for each approach.

### Timeframes and Processing Speed

Online updates through the [UIDAI website complete much faster](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) than visiting physical centers. The digital process typically takes 5-7 working days once submitted.

Users can track their application status immediately online. They receive SMS updates at each stage of processing.

Offline updates at Aadhaar Seva Kendras take 15-30 days for completion. The physical process involves longer waiting times due to manual verification steps.

**Appointment scheduling** can add extra days to offline processing. Peak hours at centers often mean longer queues and delays.

### Document Requirements Differences

Online updates accept only specific digital formats of address proof documents. Users must upload scanned copies that meet UIDAI file size and quality standards.

The system requires **self-attested digital documents** in PDF or JPEG format. Each file must be under 2MB and clearly readable.

[Offline centers accept original documents](https://moneyview.in/insights/how-to-update-aadhar-card) along with photocopies for verification. Officials can examine physical documents for authenticity.

**Document flexibility** is greater offline. Centers accept a wider range of address proofs, including older utility bills and handwritten rent agreements.

### Situational Recommendations

Choose online updates when you have a registered mobile number linked to your Aadhaar. This method works best for tech-savvy users comfortable with digital processes.

**Rural residents** often benefit from offline updates due to internet connectivity issues. Village-level entrepreneurs and post offices provide easier access.

Select offline processing for complex address changes involving multiple corrections. [Aadhaar Seva Kendras offer personalized guidance](https://www.paisabazaar.com/aadhar-card/aadhaar-card-update-correction/) from trained officials.

**First-time updaters** should consider offline methods for hands-on assistance. Officials help fill forms correctly and verify document requirements on the spot.

## Tracking and Status of Aadhaar Address Update Requests

Once someone submits an Aadhaar address update request, they receive a unique tracking number and can monitor their application's progress through multiple channels. The system sends automatic notifications about status changes, and applicants need to know how to handle rejections if they occur.

### Understanding URN, SRN, and Their Usage

When someone [successfully submits an address update request](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html), the system generates a Service Request Number (SRN). This SRN appears on the screen immediately after submission.

The SRN is also called an Update Request Number (URN) in some contexts. Both terms refer to the same tracking identifier.

People receive this number through SMS on their registered mobile phone. The [SRN number gets included in the invoice](https://www.uidai.gov.in/en/922-faqs/aadhaar-online-services/online-address-update-process/11972-q8-i-successfully-submitted-my-address-update-request-how-can-i-track-this.html) that they can download after submitting their request.

**Key uses of SRN/URN:**

* Track application status online
* Reference number for customer service calls
* Required for downloading updated Aadhaar card
* Proof of submission for records

### Receiving Notifications and Invoices

The UIDAI system sends automatic updates about request status. People receive SMS notifications on their registered mobile number when their application moves through different stages.

After submitting a request, applicants should download the invoice immediately. This invoice contains important details like the SRN number and submission timestamp.

**What the invoice includes:**

* Service Request Number (SRN)
* Date and time of submission
* Type of update requested
* Contact information for support

People can [track their Aadhaar update status](https://ogos.in/how-to-check-aadhaar-update-status/) by visiting the official UIDAI website. They need to enter their SRN and other required details.

The tracking system shows different status updates like "Under Process," "Approved," or "Rejected." Processing times vary but typically take 7-10 working days.

### What to Do If the Update is Rejected

Address update requests get rejected for specific reasons. The most common causes include invalid documents, mismatched information, or unclear document images.

[Invalid document rejections happen](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) when the proof of address document doesn't meet UIDAI requirements. The document must be in the applicant's name and match their address details exactly.

**Common rejection reasons:**

* Document not in applicant's name
* Address mismatch between form and document
* Poor quality or black-and-white document scan
* Expired or invalid proof of address

When a request gets rejected, people receive an SMS with the rejection reason. They can submit a new request after fixing the identified issues.

People should check the official list of accepted documents before resubmitting. They need to ensure their document scan is clear, colored, and shows all required details clearly.

## Important Tips for a Successful Aadhaar Address Update

Getting your Aadhaar address updated correctly requires attention to document quality, proper language formatting, and avoiding simple mistakes that cause delays. Following these specific guidelines will help ensure your application gets approved quickly.

### Ensuring Document Clarity and Format

Clear, readable documents are essential for [successful Aadhaar address updates](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html). Poor quality scans often lead to rejection.

**Document Quality Requirements:**

* Use 300 DPI or higher resolution for scans
* Ensure all text is clearly readable
* Remove shadows and glare from photos
* Keep file size under 2MB per document

For online updates, applicants must [combine all rental agreement pages into a single PDF file](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/documents/how-to-update-the-aadhaar-card-address-with-rent-agreement/articleshow/72467863.cms). UIDAI rejects multiple JPEG or JPG images.

**Essential Document Checklist:**

| Document Type    | Format Required | Color/B\&W      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Rental Agreement | Single PDF      | Color preferred |
| Utility Bills    | PDF or JPEG     | Either          |
| Bank Statements  | PDF             | Either          |

Original documents are mandatory for offline visits to enrollment centers.

### Language and Transliteration Considerations

Aadhaar forms require information in both English and the local regional language. Incorrect spelling or transliteration often causes processing delays.

**Address Entry Guidelines:**

* Write the complete address in English first
* Use proper capitalization and punctuation
* Avoid abbreviations like "St." for Street
* Include PIN code and state name clearly

The local language section must match the English version exactly. Many applicants face rejection when the two versions don't align properly.

**Common Language Mistakes:**

* Using different spellings between English and regional text
* Missing mandatory fields in either language
* Using special characters that systems cannot read

Double-check both versions before submitting. Consider asking someone fluent in the regional language to verify accuracy.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Several preventable mistakes cause Aadhaar address update rejections. Understanding these issues helps applicants avoid delays.

**Document-Related Problems:**

* **Non-registered rental agreements**: [Only registered rental agreements are accepted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/documents/how-to-update-the-aadhaar-card-address-with-rent-agreement/articleshow/72467863.cms)
* **Wrong name on documents**: Proof must be in the applicant's name, not family members
* **Expired documents**: Ensure all proof documents are current and valid

**Process Mistakes:**

* Forgetting to save the Update Request Number (URN)
* Not keeping acknowledgment receipts
* Using wrong mobile number for OTP verification

**Address Format Errors:**

* Incomplete addresses missing landmarks or area names
* Mismatched information between old and new addresses
* Incorrect PIN codes or district names

Always verify mobile number registration before starting the online process. Keep digital and physical copies of all submitted documents for future reference.

## After the Update: Next Steps and Best Practices

Once the address update is complete, users need to download their updated Aadhaar card and inform banks, employers, and government agencies about the change. Proper storage and protection of Aadhaar details prevents misuse and identity theft.

### Downloading or Printing Updated Aadhaar

Users can [download their updated Aadhaar card](https://uidai.gov.in/en/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html) from the official UIDAI website once the update process is complete. The system sends an SMS notification to the registered mobile number when the card is ready for download.

To download the updated card, users visit the myAadhaar portal and enter their Aadhaar number and registered mobile number. They receive an OTP for verification.

The downloaded file comes as a password-protected PDF. The password is typically the first four letters of the holder's name in capital letters followed by their birth year.

Users should print multiple copies of their updated Aadhaar card on good quality paper. They need these copies for various official purposes like bank account updates or job applications.

### Notifying Relevant Institutions of Address Change

Financial institutions require updated address proof within a specific timeframe. Banks, credit card companies, and insurance providers need the new Aadhaar details to maintain accurate records.

Users should update their address with these key institutions:

* **Banks and credit unions**
* **Employers and HR departments**
* **Insurance companies**
* **Telecom service providers**
* **Utility companies**
* **Government benefit programs**

Many institutions accept the updated Aadhaar card as valid address proof. Users can submit copies online through customer portals or visit branch offices in person.

Some organizations may require additional documents along with the updated Aadhaar card. Users should check specific requirements before visiting or submitting documents.

### Safeguarding Aadhaar Details

The Aadhaar card contains sensitive personal information that requires careful protection. Users should never share their complete Aadhaar number on social media or unsecured websites.

When providing Aadhaar copies, users can mask the first eight digits and show only the last four numbers. This practice reduces the risk of identity theft while still serving verification purposes.

Users should store physical copies in secure locations away from moisture and direct sunlight. Digital copies should be saved on password-protected devices or encrypted cloud storage.

**Important security measures:**

* Never carry the original Aadhaar card unnecessarily
* Use photocopies for routine verification
* Avoid sharing Aadhaar details over phone calls
* Report lost or stolen cards immediately to UIDAI

Users can enable biometric locking through the UIDAI website to add extra security to their Aadhaar authentication process.
